# Number Systems

## Concepts Covered
1. Binary to Decimal Conversion
2. Decimal to Binary Conversion
3. Two's Complement
4. Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion

## Code Snippets
- `binary_to_decimal.c`: Converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
- `decimal_to_binary.c`: Converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent using recursion.
- `twos_complement.c`: Finds the two's complement of a number.
- `hex_to_binary.c`: Converts a hexadecimal number to its binary equivalent.

## Notes
- Two's complement simplifies arithmetic operations for signed integers.
- Hexadecimal is a compact representation of binary values (4 bits per hex digit).

## How to Run
```bash
gcc binary_to_decimal.c -o binary_to_decimal
./binary_to_decimal 110101
